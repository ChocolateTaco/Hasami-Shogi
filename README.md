Hasami Shogi is a Japanese board game similar to checkers. This version of the game follows "Variant 1" on the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasami_shogi) and is intended to be played with two players. The game uses only one type of piece that can move horizontally or vertically, similar to a rook in chess â™œ. The main object is to capture all but one of the opposing player's pieces (or men).

## Prerequisites
[Python 3.6 or later](https://www.python.org/)

## Installation
1. Clone the repo to a local directory
2. In the local directory, open a terminal and install the requirements:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## How to Play

1. Players alternate turns (Black starts first, then Red)
2. Pieces can only move vertically or horizontally (similar to a Rook in Chess).
3. Pieces are captured (either vertically or horziontally) when they are "sandwiched" by opposing pieces, only on their turn. *Note: A player's piece will not be lost on their turn if their move sandwiches themselves between the opponents pieces. In other words, a player cannot purposely lose their piece.*
